  “Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”
   - Jalaluddin Rumi

  "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning."

  "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."
   - Steve Jobs
  The great thing about a short story is that it doesn’t have to trawl through someone’s whole life; it can come in glancingly from the side. ~Emma Donoghue

  A short story is a different thing all together - a short story is like a kiss in the dark from a stranger. ~Stephen King

  Women want love to be a novel, men a short story. ~Daphne du Maurier

  A good [short story] would take me out of myself and then stuff me back in, outsized, now, and uneasy with the fit. ~David Sedaris

  Newt Gingrich wrote a novel, and he’s a short story. Bill Clinton wrote a biography, and he’s a novel. ~James McBride

  A short story must have a single mood and every sentence must build towards it. ~Edgar Allan Poe

  A short story is a shard, a sliver, a vignette. It’s a biopsy on the human condition but it doesn’t have this capacity to think autonomously for itself. ~Will Self
  Short fiction seems more targeted - hand grenades of ideas, if you will. When they work, they hit, they explode, and you never forget them. Long fiction feels more like atmosphere: it’s a lot smokier and less defined. ~Paolo Bacigalupi

  My highest point was the first thing I won, a short story competition in a women’s magazine in the Eighties. It was the first time I’d had my writing validated, and the first thing I’d ever shown anyone else. ~Kate Atkinson

  My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left. I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart… ~Haruki Murakami

  With a novel, which takes perhaps years to write, the author is not the same man he was at the end of the book as he was at the beginning. It is not only that his characters have developed—he has developed with them, and this nearly always gives a sense of roughness to the work: a novel can seldom have the sense of perfection which you find in Chekhov’s story, The Lady with the Dog. ~Graham Greene

  I believe that the short story is as different a form from the novel as poetry is, and the best stories seem to me to be perhaps closer in spirit to poetry than to novels. ~Tobias Wolff

  The short story is still like the novel’s wayward younger brother, we know that it’s not respectable - but I think that can also add to the glory of it. ~Neil Gaiman

  I used to write things for friends. There was this girl I had a crush on, and she had a teacher she didn’t like at school. I had a real crush on her, so almost every day I would write her a little short story where she would kill him in a different way. ~Stephen Colbert
  I find it satisfying and intellectually stimulating to work with the intensity, brevity, balance and word play of the short story. ~Annie Proulx

  If you look at my last songs and first short stories, there is a real connection between them. ~Kazuo Ishiguro
  I’m a failed poet. Maybe every novelist wants to write poetry first, finds he can’t and then tries the short story which is the most demanding form after poetry. And failing at that, only then does he take up novel writing. ~William Faulkner

  Somewhere around the place I’ve got an unfinished short story about Schrodinger’s Dog; it was mostly moaning about all the attention the cat was getting. ~Terry Pratchett

  When you read a short story, you come out a little more aware and a little more in love with the world around you. ~George Saunders
